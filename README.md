💬 Toxic Comment Classification
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can automatically detect and classify toxic comments in online discussions. The model identifies various types of toxicity, including threats, insults, obscenity, and identity-based hate.

📌 Overview
🧠 NLP project for classifying comments as toxic or non-toxic

🧹 Includes full preprocessing pipeline: cleaning, tokenizing, padding

🔤 Uses deep learning (e.g., LSTM or CNN) or classical ML methods

📊 Evaluates performance with accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix

📁 Compatible with Jigsaw's Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset
